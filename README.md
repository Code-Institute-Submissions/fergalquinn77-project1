# Kennedy's Bar

Kennedy's Bar website is designed for T.J Kennedys Bar, Sligo. It is to provide information about the venue, contact details and the option of booking a table. 

Users of the site will be able to browse pictures of the venue in the Gallery section. They will also be able to submit a contact enquiry or make a booking through the Resdiary booking portal which is on the home page.
