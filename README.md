# Kennedy's Bar

Kennedy's Bar website is designed for T.J Kennedys Bar, Sligo. It is to provide information about the venue, contact details and the option of booking a table. 

Users of the site will be able to browse pictures of the venue in the Gallery section. They will also be able to submit a contact enquiry or make a booking through the Resdiary booking portal which is on the home page.

## Technologies Used

Languages used:

- HTML
- CSS

## Planned Further Development

- I would like to use Javascript to make the navigation menu more responsive, particularily for mobile devices.

## Testing

- I tested that the page works in the different browsers: [Chrome](assets/images/chrome-testing.jpg), Safari (via [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com)), [Firefox](assets/images/firefox-testing.jpg).
- I confirmed that this project is [responsive](assets/images/responsive-home.jpg), looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using devtools device toolbar.
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, & contact-us text are all readable and easy to understand.
- I have confirmed that the form works. It requires entries at every field and it will only accept an email in the email field. The submit button works.

## Validator Testing

- HTML
    - No errors were found when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). Here are the results of each page - [Homepage](assets/images/index-html-check.jpg), [Contact-Us](assets/images/contact-us-html-check.jpg), [Gallery](assets/images/gallery-html-check.jpg). There is a warning relating to Javasc
- CSS
    - No errors were found when passing through the offical [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator). [Click here](assets/images/css-check.jpg) for results.
- Accessibility
    - Confirmed that font choice was easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools. Note the best practices performance was effected by the inclusion of Javascript (for booking portal), which is outside of my control.
